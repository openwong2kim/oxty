## alacritty_terminal 0.26.0

Copyright Christian Duerr, Joe Wilm and the Alacritty contributors.
Source: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. A copy of the license is
included in this package as `LICENSE-APACHE`.

**Modified.** oxtty compiles a patched copy (`crates/oxtty/src/vt` in
https://github.com/openwong2kim/oxtty). The changes are:

- character widths use the xterm.js Unicode 11 table (below);
- resizing can leave the cursor paragraph without reflow (xterm.js
  `reflowCursorLine: false`), which oxtty enables;
- SGR 5 blink is stored in a cell flag;
- the PTY and event-loop modules and their dependencies are removed.

The full list is in `crates/oxtty/src/vt/PATCHES.md` in the repository.

## xterm.js 6.1.0-beta.336 — input encoding

The keyboard, mouse, wheel, paste and focus encoders of oxtty
(`crates/oxtty/src/input` in https://github.com/openwong2kim/oxtty), compiled
into the WebAssembly modules that use them, are a Rust port of xterm.js
6.1.0-beta.336 (commit 08829c7eb6279dda2a9e86df901353a1a89858ca):
`src/common/input/Keyboard.ts`, `src/common/input/KittyKeyboard.ts`,
`src/common/services/MouseStateService.ts` and parts of
`src/browser/services/MouseService.ts`, `src/browser/Clipboard.ts` and
`src/browser/CoreBrowserTerminal.ts`. The textarea, IME and mouse handling
of the browser front end (`crates/oxtty-web/src/input`, compiled into
`xterm_web_bg.wasm`) is a Rust port of parts of
`src/browser/CoreBrowserTerminal.ts`, `src/browser/input/CompositionHelper.ts`,
`src/browser/input/MoveToCell.ts`, `src/browser/input/Mouse.ts`,
`src/browser/Clipboard.ts`, `src/browser/services/KeyboardService.ts`,
`src/browser/services/MouseService.ts`,
`src/browser/services/MouseCoordsService.ts` and
`src/browser/services/SelectionService.ts` of the same version. Each Rust file
names its source lines.
The parser handler identifiers of the browser front end
(`crates/oxtty-web/src/parser.rs`) are checked as in
`src/common/parser/EscapeSequenceParser.ts` of the same version.
